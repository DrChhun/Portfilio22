        <p data-aos="fade-up" class="mt-12">I'm Chhun, a front end web developer 
                        with a background in Computer Science. I enjoy creating things that live on the 
                        internet and turning problems into beautiful designs. 
                        I primarily focus on JavaScript, HTML, CSS, JS Framwork 
                        and CSS Framwork.
                        While I love front end development and design, I'm also 
                        comfortable using back-end tech including Laravel and MySQL.<br>
                        Transitioning to web development has enabled me to continue my passion for 
                        learning and embrace my status as a forever student.</p>
